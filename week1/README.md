This folder contains basic HTML and CSS practice tasks along with an interactive quiz assignment using JavaScript. The goal is to build a strong foundation in structure, layout, and dynamic behavior.

Task 1: Build an HTML table displaying employment data with fields such as Employee ID, Name, and Designation.

Task 2:Create a "Holy Grail" layout using HTML and CSS with structural sections like header, sidebar, main content, and footer.

Assignment:Build a quiz app that shows one question at a time, with a timer, and displays the final score in a pop-up or overlay.

- Load questions dynamically from a JSON file
- Countdown timer for each question
- Auto-skip on timeout or manual next
- Final result summary in an overlay
